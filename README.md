# DNA Similarity

## Overview

The DNA Similarity Calculator is a Python program that allows you to compare DNA sequences and perform various DNA similarity analyses. It provides functions to count the number of matches between two sequences, find the maximum contiguous chain of matches, and align sequences to maximize either matches or the maximum contiguous chain. This tool is useful for bioinformatics and genetic research.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.

## Description

[Insert a brief project description here.]

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

Usage
The DNA Similarity Calculator provides multiple options for analyzing DNA sequences. You can choose to count matches, find the maximum contiguous chain, or align sequences for the best similarity based on your needs.

The program guides you through each step and provides an interactive interface for input.
